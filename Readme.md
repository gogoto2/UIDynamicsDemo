# UIKit Dynamics Demo

This is a simple demo app I created for an [Indy CocoaHeads](http://www.meetup.com/indycocoaheads/) lightning talk on UIKit Dynamics. Showcases gravity, collision, snap, and push.

Also contains a bonus example usage of new `UIView` animation method in iOS 7, `animateWithDuration:delay:usingSpringWithDamping:initialSpringVelocity:options:animations:completion:`.
